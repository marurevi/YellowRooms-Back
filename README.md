> We created it following the BDD method (Behavioral Driven Development). To improve the efficiency of our test, we add to this project a coverage gem to allow us to keep a register of the test behavior.

> The coverage gem generates an HTML inform that can be found in the path `YellowRooms-Back/coverage/index.html`
